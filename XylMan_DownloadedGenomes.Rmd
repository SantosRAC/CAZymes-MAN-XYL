We have been downloading genomes from Fungi, Bacteria and Archaea from NCBI.

This document just shows a summary of what we have downloaded so far.

All the genome info (not the sequence data so far) had been stores in a MariaDB database.
 

```{r}
library(RMariaDB)
setwd("D:/GitHub/CAZymes-MAN-XYL/")
con<-dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(),groups="xylman",default.file='DB/xylman.cnf')
dbListTables(con)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
